# Array Challenges
This was a brief exercise involving arrays completed for Coding Dojo
### Objectives:
1. Always Hungry<br/>
Write a function that is given an array and each time the value is `"food"` it should console log `"yummy"`. If `"food"` was not present in the array console log `"I'm hungry"` once.
2. High Pass Filter<br/>
Given an array and a value `cutoff`, return a new array containing only the values larger than `cutoff`
3. Better than Average<br/>
Given an array of numbers return a count of how many of the numbers are larger than the average.
4. Array Reverse<br/>
Write a function that will reverse the values an array and return them. (I assumed `reverse()` is not allowed.)
5. Fibonacci Array<br/>
Fibonacci numbers have been studied for years and appear often in nature. Write a function that will return an array of Fibonacci numbers up to a given length `n`. Fibonacci numbers are calculated by adding the last two values in the sequence together. So if the 4th value is `2` and the 5th value is `3` then the next value in the sequence is `5`.
### Additional functionality for extra practice:
* I did them all in Python for extra practice.
